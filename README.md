**Home Credit** faces the challenge of accurately predicting loan default risk for clients with limited or no credit history. This problem is crucial for the company, affecting loan approval decisions
and portfolio performance. Home Credit can make informed loan decisions by identifying potential defaulters and approving or denying applications accordingly. Success will be measured
by the model's predictive accuracy and its ability to distinguish high-risk clients. This classification problem involves a binary target variable: default or non-default. We will
evaluate the model using logistic regression or decision trees.

The project encompasses data preprocessing, exploratory analysis, model testing and development, and performance validation. Our collaborative team of 4 MSBA students aims to deliver an efficient predictive model within the next month. Key milestones include data cleaning, creating exploratory data
analysis, testing the model, and submitting the project with accurate outcomes.

While doing the exploratory data analysis, our team found many columns with missing values. We decided to impute the data of these columns by replacing 'XNA' with 'None'. This
